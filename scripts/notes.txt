   # to get reservation ID, look for physical ID under reservations from this command:
   climate lease-show <lease id>

   # creation:
   climate lease-create --physical-reservation min=1,max=1,resource_properties='["=", "$node_type", "compute"]' --start-date "2015-06-17 16:00" --end-date "2015-06-17 18:00"  my-first-lease

steps for creating kvm cluster:
    A. One time things
        i. allocate lease (climate)
        ii. allocate nodes (nova) with names kvm-varbench-<id>
        iii. allocate single floating IP address for node-0
        iv. allocate 1 neutron port per VM, with name prefix 'vm'
        v. run create-neutron-dns-list.py to map the freshly allocated mac addresses to ports and hostnames

    B. From the head node
        i. for each host, run 'scp vm.xml to node; ssh <ip address> "sudo ./vm-run.sh"
        ii. for each VM IP address, run "scp neutron-dns-list <ip address>:"
        iii. for each node, run 'ssh <ip address> "virsh destroy vm"
        iv. repeat step i.

    C. profit


other gotchas:
    setting up ssh keys on the cluster

    i. scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa* to the head node
    ii. scp from the head node to all other nodes
    iii. disable strict key checking on each node (use the scp utility)
